#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

<!-- ÊèêÁ§∫Ê†áÈ¢òÁøªËØë -->

1\. **Legal Validity:** Consult a lawyer to ensure enforceability of the terms

<!-- ÊèêÁ§∫ÂÜÖÂÆπÁøªËØë -->

2\. **Conflicting Clauses:** The requirement "modified versions cannot be distributed" conflicts with common modpack ecosystems (which often require minor adjustments for compatibility)

3\. **Alternative Proposal:** For broader adoption, consider the following more permissive option:

// More permissive option (balancing dissemination and protection): - Code under MIT License (permits free modification/distribution with attribution) - Non-code resources under CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 (prohibits commercial use, modification, requires attribution)
